I am a **second-year Ph.D. student** in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at University of California, San Diego. I am advised by [Professor Alex Orailoglu](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~alex/). My research interests lie in **hardware security**. My research has focused on securing hardware designs against supply chain threats by leveraging synthesis and testing methodologies.

## My research
Since the vast majority of semiconductor companies have adopted the **fabless** business model, chip designs are facing security threats in the outsourcing stages such as overproduction and IP piracy.
Most of the past developments on hardware protection operate in an **inherently restricted** obfuscation paradigm and thus are trapped in continual iterations of empirical defenses and attacks.
Therefore, the central theme of my work is to address hardware security threats by incorporating obfuscation needs as an **integrated optimization objective** throughout the hardware design flow.
